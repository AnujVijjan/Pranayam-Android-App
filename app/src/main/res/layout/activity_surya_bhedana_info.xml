The Surya Bhedan Kumbhaka a breathing technique from Pranayama, which is one of the eight Mahakumbhakas. Where Surya means the sun or the sun channel ( Pingala ). and the meaning of the word “Bhedana” is piercing or enter or breaking through something.  \n\nIn Suryabhedi Pranayama, the complementary action is performed through the right pore of the nose. The right pore of the nose is called the sun tone and the left is called the moon tone. In the process of inhaling the breath through the right hole, the energy flows through the Pingala Nadi ie Surya Nadi. In exhaling from the left pore, energy flows through the Ida pulse or the lunar pulse.  \n\nPerforming this Suryabhedi Pranayam purifies the pulse present in the body known as Pingala Nadi. Additionally, surya Nadi also becomes active by doing this. Due to this reason, this pranayama has been named Suryabhedi Pranayama.  \n\nSurya Bheda is a breathing exercise to strengthen solar energy, to increase warmth, willpower, and enthusiasm.  \n\nThe practice of Surya Bhedana Pranayama stimulates the root chakra, increases the vitality of the body as well as relief from anxiety, depression, and mental illness."/>
